## Digital Scholarship?

Digital scholarship is by its nature collaborative, multi-disciplinary and draws upon a broad range of expertise from across librarianship, research data management, data visualization, data processing, digital preservation, and digital pedagogy. The Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) is the hub to explore, discover, create, and play with data and visual tools, methods, and objects, and to contribute that knowledge back to the community.

The goal of this website is to provide an additional place to host instructional material, code, and data for all of our workshops, projects, aand tutorials. 

Please check out our [primary homepage](https://brocku.ca/library/dsl) to get the full picture of all that we do.
